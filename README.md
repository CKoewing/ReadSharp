ReadSharp was previously **PocketSharp.Reader** and is now hosted without the [PocketSharp](https://github.com/ceee/PocketSharp) dependency.

## What's it all about?

The library extracts the main content of a website and returns the extracted content as HTML and it's associated title, as well as other useful content (images, icons, ...).

This content can be encapsulated in a `<body>`-Tag and displayed as a readable website with a custom CSS (it's up to you!).
